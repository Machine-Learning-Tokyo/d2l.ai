# MLT Dive into Deep Learning: Study and coding sessions (APAC)

The goal of this series is to provide code-focused sessions by reimplementing selected models from the interactive open source book [Dive into Deep Learning](http://d2l.ai/) by Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li and Alexander J. Smola. These sessions are meant for people who are interested in implementing models from scratch and/or never have implemented a model before. We hope to help participants either get started in their Machine Learning journey or deepen their knowledge if they already have previous experience.

**Prerequisites:** It's highly recommended to have at least intermediate Python skills as we will be using PyTorch to implement models. We also recommend participants have a foundational knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and statistics/probability theory.
